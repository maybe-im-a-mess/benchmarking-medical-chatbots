      "point": "[RISK] Risk of immediate cesarean section due to complications such as changes in the fetus's heart rate, suspected premature placental detachment, bleeding, or umbilical cord complications.",
      "rationale": "Priority: HIGH | Topic: Anesthesia"
    },
    {
      "point": "[RISK] Possible loss of fetal heart tones, which may improve with medication and could necessitate a cesarean section.",
      "rationale": "Priority: MEDIUM | Topic: Anesthesia"
    },
    {
      "point": "[RISK] Risk of bladder rupture, which may lead to a normal delivery or cesarean section depending on fetal position and birth plan.",
      "rationale": "Priority: MEDIUM | Topic: Anesthesia"
    },
    {
      "point": "[RISK] Maternal tachycardia or fetal tachycardia as a side effect of the tocolytic medication.",
      "rationale": "Priority: MEDIUM | Topic: Anesthesia"

    {
      "point": "[RISK] Pain during the procedure may lead to termination of the maneuver.",
      "rationale": "Priority: MEDIUM | Topic: Anesthesia"
    },
    {
      "point": "[RISK] Vaginal bleeding may occur, and in severe cases, a cesarean section, labor induction, or further observation may be required. In rare cases, fetomaternal transfusion may occur, leading to maternal immunological reaction and potential fetal complications, especially in Rh-negative mothers with Rh-positive fetuses.",
      "rationale": "Priority: HIGH | Topic: Anesthesia"
    },
    {
      "point": "[RISK] Allergic reactions (e.g., to latex or medications) may cause acute circulatory shock requiring intensive medical treatment. In very rare cases, severe, possibly permanent damage (e.g., organ injury, brain damage, paralysis) may occur.",
      "rationale": "Priority: HIGH | Topic: Anesthesia"
    },
    {
      "point": "[RISK] Skin, tissue, or nerve injuries from positioning and procedural measures (e.g., injections, disinfection, laser, electric current) are rare but may result in pain, inflammation, tissue death, scarring, and permanent sensory or functional impairments, including paralysis.",
      "rationale": "Priority: LOW | Topic: Anesthesia"

    {
      "point": "[PREREQUISITE] Ultrasound to confirm fetal position (e.g., breech, transverse, oblique), fetal size, amniotic fluid volume, and placental location.",

      "point": "[INSTRUCTION] Patient should fast for several hours before the procedure, as advised by the doctor, to prepare for potential emergency cesarean section under anesthesia.",

      "point": "[INSTRUCTION] Patient should bring the mother's passport to the consultation for medical records and information.",
      "rationale": "Priority: MEDIUM | Topic: Anesthesia"

      "point": "[INSTRUCTION] The doctor will explain whether a cesarean section is possible in case of failure and whether further monitoring or intervention is needed.",

    {
      "point": "[GENERAL_INFO] External cephalic version is typically performed between 37 and 38 weeks of gestation when success rates are highest and the fetus is less likely to revert to a breech position.",
      "rationale": "Priority: LOW | Topic: Anesthesia"

      "point": "[GENERAL_INFO] If labor is triggered by the procedure, the fetus is considered mature enough for delivery.",

    {
      "point": "[GENERAL_INFO] Fetal heart tones are monitored continuously during and after the procedure to ensure fetal well-being.",

    {
      "point": "[GENERAL_INFO] The procedure is generally not painful, though pressure on the abdomen may be uncomfortable.",

      "point": "[GENERAL_INFO] A supportive belt may be provided temporarily to stabilize the fetus in the new position.",

      "point": "[RISK] External cephalic version is contraindicated if placenta previa or vasa previa is present, as these conditions pose significant risks to both mother and fetus.",
      "rationale": "Priority: HIGH | Topic: Anesthesia"
    },
    {
      "point": "[RISK] Contraindicated in cases of maternal conditions (e.g., uterine malformations, chronic infections, severe bleeding disorders) or fetal conditions (e.g., abnormal heart rate, suspected open spine, poor growth, poor placental perfusion), or if there is a mismatch between fetal size and maternal pelvis, especially in multiple pregnancies.",
      "rationale": "Priority: HIGH | Topic: Anesthesia"

      "point": "[INSTRUCTION] Rh-negative mothers are advised to receive Rh immunoglobulin (anti-D) to prevent sensitization and potential hemolytic disease of the fetus, even if no version is performed.",
